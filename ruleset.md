### Branch Protection and Code Approval Guidelines

Welcome to our GitHub repository! To ensure code quality and maintain consistency within our project, we have implemented branch protection rules and code approval guidelines. Please read through the following instructions carefully before contributing.

#### Branch Protection Rules:

1. **Approval Requirement:** Before any code can be merged into the main branch, it must be approved by either Fabian Baitura or Paul Nell.
  
2. **Branch Naming Convention:** When working on new features or fixes, please create a new branch with a name that clearly describes the purpose of your changes. Avoid using vague or generic branch names.

3. **Timeline for Review:** It is essential to allow sufficient time for code review and potential revisions. Therefore, all changes should be completed and submitted for review at least 2 days before the end of the sprint.

#### How to Contribute:

To contribute to the project and ensure smooth code integration, follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Branch:**
   - Use a descriptive name for your branch, reflecting the task or feature you are working on. For example:
     ```
     feature/add-user-authentication
     fix/bug-in-payment-processing
     refactor/update-database-schema
     ```

2. **Work on Your Changes:**
   - Make necessary modifications, additions, or fixes within your branch. Ensure that your changes adhere to clean coding standards, such as proper formatting, meaningful variable names, a clear class structure and if needed, a clear documentation.

3. **Push Changes and Open Pull Request:**
   - Once your work is completed, push your branch to the repository and open a pull request (PR) targeting the main branch.

4. **Request Review:**
   - Assign either Fabian Baitura or Paul Nell as a reviewer for your PR. Without their approval, the code cannot be merged.

5. **Address Feedback (if any):**
   - If any feedback or suggestions are provided during the review process, make the necessary adjustments to your code within the same branch.

6. **Merge into Main:**
   - Once your code has been approved, it will be merged into the main branch, ensuring that it becomes a part of the project's official codebase.

If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to Fabian Baitura or Paul Nell. Happy coding!
